        <p>
          My first car was a 1963 Ford Falcon Sprint with a broken speedometer
          and a working tachometer. Armed with a few mathematical formulas and
          an Apple IIe, I wrote a program in basic to calculate speed using the
          RPM displayed on the tachometer. I fell in love with programming that
          day. I held a variety of jobs over the years, but programming was
          always something more for me. I learned several languages in college
          including Basic, Pascal, C, and C++. Even though I took a different
          career path, I wrote a few applications during the early days.

          I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in electrical engineering from Louisiana
          Tech and a law degree from George Washington University. I am looking
          for more interesting challenges and have stopped practicing patent law
          to focus on software development.

          Early in my career I worked at the United States Patent and Trademark
          Office in the area of multicomputer data transferring, think HTTP. I
          was there when my coworker issued a notice of allowance in a patent
          application to Netscape Communications. The application became U.S.
          patent number 5,774,670. It was the first patent on cookies.
